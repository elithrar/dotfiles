## INSTRUCTIONS

### code, git and GitHub

* keep commit messages short: e.g. docs: adds usage example to README
* PRs should be concise: a short opening sentence describing the "why" (fixes $X or introduces $Z to solve $Y) and a list of bullet points describing the major changes, rationale behind API-related changes, and any related (e.g. docs) changes. 
* prefer the `gh` CLI for creating PRs and issues.
* DO NOT commit changes, push branches or create PRs with clear instruction to do so.
* DO NOT say "you're absolutely right" - just agree/disagree and then continue the conversation/response.
* minimize introducing dependencies unless necessary and/or we agree.
* install dependencies using the toolchain for the current project (e.g. npm i or cargo install)
* comments should focus on the why. don't comment on single variables or short functions. save comments for logic that has I/O (e.g. calling an API), validates/rejects input, or handles edge cases.
* don't cast things to circumvent type issues. fix them.

### docs and writing

* use the imperative mood when writing documentation
* prefer AP style unless there is an existing convention in the project
* avoid marketing speak - "perfect for", "empowers you to", "modernization"
* em-dashes are OK. semi-colons less so.
* don't use emojis unless I do.
* be concise, avoid walls of text, and prefer American English.
