Review the blog post using these criteria:

1. **Structure**: Is it well-organized for a technical audience (101+)? Clear intro, logical flow, actionable conclusion?
2. **Thought leadership**: Does it make the reader think "I should build on Cloudflare"? Does it showcase unique capabilities or insights?
3. **Call-to-action**: Is there a clear next step for the reader?
4. **Code examples**: Are they accurate, valid, and explained in prose? Do they serve the narrative?

Provide confident recommendations. Be direct about what works and what needs improvement.
